# Transitive Identity & Embedded Claims
## Proof of Concept

This Proof of Concept simulates a banking application with two frontends: Subject Workload and Subject Workload Mobile. The business logic says that only Subject Workload is allowed to use DA-SVIDs to access specific functions as check balance and make deposits in behalf of end-user.

In this scenario, all workloads are SPIFFE identified Docker containers and the Asserting Workload is a trusted component allowed to mint new DA-SVID tokens. When the the application frontend needs to access end-user data, it stablish an SPIRE mTLS connection with Asserting Workload, sending the end-user OAuth token. The Asserting Workload, by its side, receives the OAuth token, mint a DA-SVID (claims described at ... ref doc...) and sign with its private key (can be its SVID or another specific key), sending back to subject workload.

Middle tier simulates a generic cloud application component (e.g. load balancer), to exemplify DA-SVID transitivity. In this PoC, when receive requests that uses DA-SVID, it first validate its expiration and signature. After that, middle tier uses Asserting Workload introspect endpoint to validate the DA-SVID. Requests with valid DA-SVID are send to Target Workload.

When Target Workload receives a request with DA-SVID, it also check its expiration and signature. If the token is valid, Target Workload parse its claims and verify if DA-SVID subject claim is allowed to use DA-SVID. Then, TW extract dpr claim and perform a database search for that user, returning user balance or error message.

## Prerequisites

- SPIRE-Server and Agent up and running
- SPIRE entries:
```
spire-server entry create \
    -parentID spiffe://example.org/host \
    -spiffeID spiffe://example.org/asserting_wl \
    -selector docker:label:type:assertingwl
    
spire-server entry create \
    -parentID spiffe://example.org/host \
    -spiffeID spiffe://example.org/subject_wl \
    -selector docker:label:type:subjectwl
    
spire-server entry create \
    -parentID spiffe://example.org/host \
    -spiffeID spiffe://example.org/target_wl \
    -selector docker:label:type:targetwl 
    
spire-server entry create \
    -parentID spiffe://example.org/host \
    -spiffeID spiffe://example.org/middletier \
    -selector docker:label:type:middletier 
```

- Users subject_wl and target_wl, to execute locally the components and simulate different client calls  
- Go and/or Docker

To execute in a Docker container
```
docker build . -t asserting_wl
docker run -p 8443:8443 -v /tmp/spire-agent/public/api.sock:/tmp/spire-agent/public/api.sock -d asserting_wl
```

# How it works

To access the API, clients must stablish a mTLS connection with Asserting Workload using its SVID. The asserting workload accepts any connection originated from a predefined trust domain (usually itselfs), and clients should accept connections only from specific predefined list of SPIFFE-IDs.  
When connected, clients can access /keys or /mint endpoints.

See a client example in ./client/main.go  

# /keys endpoint
Does not require any parameter, and returns the public key set to validate DA-SVIDs.

# /mint endpoint
Require a OKTA or Google OAuth token as AccessToken parameter. 

When a mint call is received, the Asserting Workload validate the OAuth token received. If the token is valido, it fetchs the SPIFFE-ID from the current mTLS session and uses it as DA-SVID subject claim. Asserting Workload fetchs its SPIFFE-ID and use it as DA-SVID issuer claim.  

After DA-SVID claims generation, the token is signed with Asserting Workload private key, that could be its SVID or another specific key. The current implementation uses a specific key, localized in ./keys.  

In the end, the Asserting Workload sends to client Oauth token expiration and signature validation results and the generated DA-SVID.
